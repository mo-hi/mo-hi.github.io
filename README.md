# Mo-Hi

My personal collection of basic javascript and css. The main documentation is on the io page: [https://mo-hi.github.io/]

- test JS: Super light-weight javascript class for testing javascript code.
- b JS: Basis javascript and prototype functions.
- nav JS: Navbar / menubar with dropdowns
- HTML template
   - tables: Every array of object (list of dictionaries) is shown in a nice html table
